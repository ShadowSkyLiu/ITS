1. Freeway traffic estimation within particle filtering framework

general model: (macroscopic models), (EKF: disadvantages,linear)
model: Based on speed-extended cell-transmission model, particle filtering framework, Kalman filter

test: The PF performance is validated and evaluated using synthetic and real traffic data from a Belgian freeway

advantages: Particle filtering allows to cope with uncertainties and nonlinearities of any kind and hence is suitable for the traffic estimation problem. Another motivation for suggesting the PF approach to the traffic flow estimation is its modularity. It is a compositional approach to filtering that is easily adapted to changes in the model of large traffic networks

distanvage: nevertheless the PF is more computationally expensive
out: traffic density and speed

input:  Sensors
are available only at some boundaries between segments.
Technological limitations, such as limited bandwidth of communication
channels, force one to average the measurements
over regular or irregular time intervals before they are transmitted
to the agent where the Bayesian update of conditional
densities is carried out.
